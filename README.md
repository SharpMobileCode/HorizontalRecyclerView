# ListViews Reinvented
ListViews in Android just got re-invented!  Well they got re-invented a while ago, but I'm just now finding out about them. :)  This is a sample application that shows you how to use a RecyclerView in place of the aging ListView.  For a detailed summary of this example application, see my blog post below.
